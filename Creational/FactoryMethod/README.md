# What is the factory method design pattern
Factory method is a creational design pattern that allows you to create an interface who's single role is to create an object.

# When should you use the factory method design pattern
* When the object's creation is complex
* When you want to decouple the object's creation from the object's responsibilities
* When the clients do not know ahead of time the type of object they would like to create
